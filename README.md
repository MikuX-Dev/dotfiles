# Dotfile Repository

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for various configurations, including themes, GTK, icons, grub theme, and wallpaper. Feel free to explore and use them as a reference or customize them for your own setup.

## Installation

To use these dotfiles on Arch Linux, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/MikuX-Dev/dotfiles.git
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies for each configuration. For example, if you're using the yay AUR helper:
```
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```
Replace package-name with the actual package name required by your dotfiles. You may also use pacman for packages available in the official Arch Linux repositories.
